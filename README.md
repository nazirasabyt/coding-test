### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, Hello
#### My name is Nazira
This is a coding test for a website for flight booking, 
Flight flow consists of three-levels

First Level: Flight Form page to fill in all data about the required flight (origin "city(airport code)" - destination "city (airport code)" - departure date - return date - passenger count ), please check the proper attachment below (1)
 
Second Level: passenger details page, depending on the number of passengers that entered in the first level, should show boxes to fill in passenger data, and each box, should have personal information, please check the proper attachment below (2)
 
Third Level: payment page, Shows all data, entered in previous levels (first & second) and puts a button to pay when I click to pay, it should connect to meta mask wallet and make a fake transaction with a fake price, please check the proper attachment below (3)

 Its a quick fix without much of error handling. Also last page connects to metamask to make fake payment
